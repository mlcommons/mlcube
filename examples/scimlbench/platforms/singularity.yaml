# Path to a singularity container. It is relative to MLBOX_ROOT/workspace:
#  - By default, containers are stored in MLBOX_ROOT/workspace if image is a file name.
#  - If it is a relative path, it is relative to MLBOX_ROOT/workspace.
#  - Absolute paths (starting with /) are used as is.

# Here, I store them in the directory outside of the MLBOX to avoid copying them back to the user host when using
# runners such as SSH.
