# MLBox

MLBox is a project that reduces friction for machine learning by ensuring that models are easily portable and reproducible, e.g., between different stacks such as different clouds, between cloud and on-prem, etc.

This is the MLBox Prototype. This is  still under construction, some parts probably don't work yet, or may have unexpected/inconsistent behaviours.
