# MLCube

MLCube is a project that reduces friction for machine learning by ensuring that models are easily portable and reproducible, e.g., between different stacks such as different clouds, between cloud and on-prem, etc.

Note: This project is still under development and some parts probably don't work yet, or may have unexpected/inconsistent behaviours.

## Installing MLCube
