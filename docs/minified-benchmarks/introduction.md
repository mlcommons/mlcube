# Minified Benchmarks

## What is a Minified Benchmark?

A minified benchmark is a reduced version of a MLCommons training benchmark designed to be easily reproduced using MLCube. It simplifies the benchmarking process by scaling down the dataset and training duration, also it has a simple installation and reproduction process.

The main advantages of these minified benchmarks are:

- **Faster Execution**: Minified benchmarks are quicker to run (between 10 to 15 mintues), allowing for faster iteration and validation.
- **Easier implementation**: By using MLCube users don't need to worry about installing everything from scratch.
- **Reference preparation**: Minified benchmarks could be used as an introductory step for users interested in executing the MLCommons reference benchmarks.
