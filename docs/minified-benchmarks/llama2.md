# LLama 2

The benchmark reference for LLama 2 can be found in this [link](https://github.com/mlcommons/training/tree/master/llama2_70b_lora), and here is the PR for the minified benchmark implementation: [link](https://github.com/mlcommons/training/pull/749).

This video explains all the following steps:

## Project setup

An important requirement is that you must have Docker installed.

```bash
# Create Python environment and install MLCube Docker runner 
virtualenv -p python3 ./env && source ./env/bin/activate && pip install pip==24.0 && pip install mlcube-docker
# Fetch the implementation from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/mlcommons/training && cd ./training
git fetch origin pull/749/head:feature/mlcube_llama2 && git checkout feature/mlcube_llama2
cd ./llama2_70b_lora/mlcube
```

Inside the mlcube directory run the following command to check implemented tasks.

```shell
mlcube describe
```

### Extra requirements

Install Rclone in your system, by following [these instructions](https://rclone.org/install/).

MLCommons hosts the model for download exclusively by MLCommons Members. You must first agree to the [confidentiality notice](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_8VIvRmXM3I8KQaYnKf7gy27Z63BBoI_I1u02f4lw6rBp3g/viewform).

When finishing the previous form, you will be redirected to a Drive folder containing a file called `CLI Download Instructions`, follow the instructions inside that file up to step: `#3 Authenticate Rclone with Google Drive`.

When finishing this step a configuration file for Rclone will contain the necessary data to download the dataset and models. To check where this file is located run the command:

```bash
 rclone config file
 ```

 **Default:** `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`

Finally copy that file inside the `workspace` folder that is located in the same path as this readme, it must have the name `rclone.conf`.

### MLCube tasks

* Core tasks:

Download dataset.

```shell
mlcube run --task=download_data -Pdocker.build_strategy=always
```

Train.

```shell
mlcube run --task=train -Pdocker.build_strategy=always
```

* Demo tasks:

Download demo dataset.

```shell
mlcube run --task=download_demo -Pdocker.build_strategy=always
```

Train demo.

```shell
mlcube run --task=demo -Pdocker.build_strategy=always
```

### Execute the complete pipeline

You can execute the complete pipeline with one single command.

* Core pipeline:

```shell
mlcube run --task=download_data,train -Pdocker.build_strategy=always
```

* Demo pipeline:

```shell
mlcube run --task=download_demo,demo -Pdocker.build_strategy=always
```
